Abstract:
Although relatively subjective, the quality of a wine is influenced by many measurable physicochemical properties. Operating from a dataset collected by Cortez et al., 2009, this paper aims to develop a classification algorithm that predicts whether a wine is high or low quality based on ten physicochemical properties. Several approaches were taken to find a model that would best predict quality: modifying quality thresholds that separate good from bad wine, removing samples containing physicochemical properties deviating more than 3 standard deviations from the mean, multi-class classification, normalizing data, and transforming data. Results showed that the best binary classification predictor of wine quality was an Extra Trees separating good from bad wine  at a quality of 5.5, and that multiclass prediction of wine quality was best modeled with an extra trees model separating wine qualities into quality groups 0-5, 6, and 7-10.
